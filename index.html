        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Dan, a graphic designer with a knack for sales and a journey into self-taught coding. My current world is
            a blend of creativity and life's simple joys, like my love for cats and the excitement of planning my
            wedding with my amazing fianc√©, Jess.</p>

        <p>In my professional life, I merge the persuasive skills honed in sales with the artistic flair of design, and
            now, the logic of coding. These experiences shape my approach, infusing each project with a unique
            perspective.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my portfolio, where each design and code line is part of my story a journey of passion,
            learning, and meaningful creation. </p>

        <p>Sikuli</p>
        <p>This is a sample of one of my first scripts I wrote in python in a software called Sikuli. It looks
            for defined images on the screen so its extremely customizable. I grew to make scripts for dozens of
            games for fun in my free time. This script specifically was part of a larger one that made me money
            passively in a game called "Rust"</p>
